 What is SpringSecurity
-------------------------
Spring Security is a comprehensive and flexible framework for securing Java applications, particularly those built with the Spring ecosystem.
 It provides robust support for authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), brute force attacks, and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.
 As a de facto standard for securing Spring-based applications, it integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot and Spring MVC, offering both sensible defaults and extensive customization options
